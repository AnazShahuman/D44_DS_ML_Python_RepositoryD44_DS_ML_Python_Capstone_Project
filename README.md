# ABC Company Employee Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is part of a Python course, where we analyze a dataset from ABC company consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns. The project involves preprocessing the dataset, performing various analysis tasks, and presenting the findings graphically.

## Preprocessing
- Corrected the data in the "height" column by replacing it with random numbers between 150 and 180 to ensure data consistency and integrity.

## Analysis Tasks
1. **Distribution of Employees Across Each Team**:
   - Determined the distribution of employees across each team and calculated the percentage split relative to the total number of employees.
2. **Segregation of Employees Based on Their Positions**:
   - Segregated employees based on their positions within the company.
3. **Predominant Age Group Among Employees**:
   - Identified the predominant age group among employees.
4. **Team and Position with the Highest Salary Expenditure**:
   - Discovered which team and position have the highest salary expenditure.
5. **Correlation Between Age and Salary**:
   - Investigated if there's any correlation between age and salary and represented it visually.

## Graphical Representations
- Created appropriate visualizations for each analysis task to present the findings effectively.

## Insights Gained
1. The distribution of employees across each team shows that some teams have a higher percentage of employees compared to others.
2. The segregation of employees based on their positions reveals which positions are more common within the company.
3. The predominant age group among employees indicates the most common age range within the company.
4. The analysis of salary expenditure highlights which team and position have the highest salary costs.
5. The correlation analysis between age and salary provides insights into whether there is a relationship between these two variables.
